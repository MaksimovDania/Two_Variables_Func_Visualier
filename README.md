The program provides the opportunity to:
- Load function values from a user-selected csv file
(for more information, see Input data).
- Set the step and range of normalization values.
- Visualize the normalized (see note) values of the function as a
surface in three-dimensional space, taking into account the specified step and range
of normalization.
- Move the camera (viewpoint) along the coordinate axes (x, y, z).
- Rotate the camera (viewpoint) relative to the coordinate axes (x, y, z).

The program has a graphical interface containing:

● A button for selecting a file (FileDialog) and a field for displaying its name.

● Visualization zone.

● Fields for entering the step between adjacent points and the normalization range.

● Control elements for moving and rotating the camera along three axes.
